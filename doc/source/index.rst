Welcome to the slomo documentation!
===================================

``slomo`` is a code for specifying and sampling from dynamical models of elliptical galaxies.  It is currently limited to spherically symmetric distributions (hence slow-rotator models).  It can be used through the supplied eponymous command line script, or programmatically through python.
