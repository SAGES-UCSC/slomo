* have classes for models
  - MassModel should reference stellar and dark components
  - DensityModel should reference surface and volume density models,
      as well as having integrated values, could be super class for MassModel
  - AnisotropyModel should reference both anisotropy profile and Jeans kernel,
      and should provide a way to compute the Jeans kernel numerically should
      an analytical form not exist

* collect all input/output into a new io module
  - get rid of warning with yaml.load
  - takes read_* functions currently in plots
  - ensures that there is a warning before overwriting files
  - switch over to HDF5 for unified output?
    both sample and mock should include input settings in the output

* figure out better scheme for lnlike_gmm
  - and correspondingly the mock GMM data

* include options (e.g., run, mock, plot) for executable script
